# The struggles of a software engineer with 2 months of experience

It's 9pm on a Tuesday evening. 

I can hear the sound of a pen clicking. It's the sound of my girlfriend jotting down notes while listening to a video conference. I think she's considering changing jobs soon.

I just finished work. It has been 68 days since I began my new job. My probation period ends on day 90. I wonder if that's 90 business days, or 90 calendar days, or 3 months? Maybe I should have asked for details. 

If there's one thing I learned from being a software developer for just over two months, it's this: **I'm not good enough; I will never be good enough.** I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm convinced there isn't one. 

Nothing could have prepared me for the nature of this job. My weeks look like this:

To solve problem A, I need to learn about B, which requires learning about C, which requires knowledge of D, which needs E, F, and G dependencies, but dependency G is not compatible with my H, so I need an older version of H, but to install H I need knowledge of I. 

I'm not exaggerating. The chain of dependencies goes on for so long that you lose sight of the original goal when you're new. That's something I wasn't prepared for. That's something school and courses do not teach--because you're learning in a simplified, closed environment. The closest thing might be The Odin Project, where you're doing stuff where you may end up having to google X, which leads to needing knowledge of Y, which requires installing library Z. But even in the average project in TOP, there's a lot of pre-readings such that you don't need to go down the rabbit hole of chasing for puzzle pieces.
