The climb to being competent is necessary. 

It's not possible to just start off being good at what you do. As a self taught developer, you are going to face numerous challenges that Computer Science majors already had the fortune of facing during their school years (the main difference being that they have to put up with a lot more BS in school, but they reap the benefits of being significantly higher in demand than us peasants, but I digress). 

Here's a progress chart I made for fun during my down time. It may or may not reflect the realities of aspiring software developers, and your case may be wildly different than this. Maybe only I suck at coding, but the following has been my experience:

# Progress Chart For a Self Taught Developer

| Years of Learning | Output Potential                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-2               | Nothing works. Tutorial hell is here. In fact, you can't even get the tutorial to work. Programming is suffering. Give up, start again, give up again, and eventually settle on a language to stick with. |
| 2-3               | Spend hours trying to get something to work. It eventually works. Often spend 10 hours to solve a problem that saves 5 minutes of time. Programming is okay. |
| 3-4               | Can make simple scripts without batting an eye. It becomes easier to land a job at this point. Programming is nice--when it works. <= I am here |
| 1                 | Job-ready. Years of learning is not a typo. Real years start back at 1 when you land a job. Companies tend to disregard self taught years (for good reason). |
| 2                 | At year 2, you've generally learned more than you did during all your years of self study combined. |
|                   |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |
|                   |                                                              |







I spent 4 hours to make a script to save me about 5 minutes a month.

And that's totally normal.
