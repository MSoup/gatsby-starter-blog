## ALT F4

The holy grail of shortcuts.

If you know, you know.

Such is the life of an aspiring developer.

Okay, that's about as cryptic as I'm willing to get.

I chose the name ALT F4 for my blog for one reason--**I switched my career from being an English Teacher (read: Assistant Language Teacher, or...ALT) to becoming a software developer.** Hence, ALT. Hence, the tech-related name. You know, "quitting" being an ALT? Ho ho ho, and now that I have your attention, I'll have you know that I spent several months brooding over a name for my blog.

Welcome.
